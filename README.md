python-ifc
==========

python-ifc is an IFC file parser in python.

The original [python-ifc package by mvaerle](https://github.com/mvaerle/python-ifc) could be used to parse the schema specifications and list entities and types.

It did not make any difference between the types and did not parse the relations of inheritance between entities.

This fork then provides an appropriate parsing of the schema specification files and the accurate count of types and entities for IFC2x3 and IFC4.

A [pull request](https://github.com/mvaerle/python-ifc/pull/6) has been sent to the original project in an attempt to pull the corrections and additions of this fork on Sep. 25th 2013.
